# Interactive Trigger Bot

This bot was originally created to help with an Escape room type event in a server I participate in. Due to the increasing interest in the working
of the escape room we agreed to release the bot publicly for open source self hosting. If you are interested in using this bot for your own escape
room or other similar event follow the instructions below to self host the bot. 

## Contributing or Reporting Issues.

To contribute to this bots coding you can fork the repository and make your edits. Once you are satisfied with and tested your edits, you can create a
pull request to request a merge of your edits into the source code of this repository. In your pull request make sure you are explaining exactly what you 
were trying to do, what you did, and what the new changes will do. Mention any new dependencies that may be needed with your edits and of course list any 
new features you've added, if any.

### What makes a great contribution

A Good Contribution is one that benefits the application from a global scope. If you are just looking to add changes for your own version of the bot, then do not
submit a pull request of your changes and just use your forked repository with changes for your bot.
