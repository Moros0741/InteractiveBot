## What makes a great contribution?

A great contribution is a contribution that enhances the project for the entire community. Adding support or functionality that will make the program easier to
run, understand, or set up. Good contributions set the path for future updates and additions that will not limit the scope of the project to a specific area, but 
instead ensure that the project remains eligible for as many applications as possible.
